# PrintShift 3.0 Build Series: Step 3

This page details how to install the motor which drives PrintShift conveyor belt that we built in step 2.  This is just the mechanical build - the electrical wiring and control are in step 4. At the end of this step, the motor will be mounted and linked to the conveyor belt.
