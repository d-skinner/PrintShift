#  Prusa Mini Conveyor Belt!

Status: Fully Functional!

This directory is the latest PrintShift Prusa Mini repository.

There are two rear motor plates - one of our users found that the updated dimensions fit his modern Prusa Mini.
Eventually I'll get another and verify, but for now - if the official doesn't fit, and the updated does - please let me know!

Thanks!
