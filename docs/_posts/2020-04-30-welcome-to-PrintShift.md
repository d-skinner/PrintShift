This is the official landing page for the PrintShift project.

The PrintShift Project is adding conveyor belts to conventional 3D printers.  The project began by adding part ejection to Prusa Minis, which is now feature-complete and has been running for thousands of printing hours.

The project will continue to work on belts, part ejection and related technologies, as well as working to improve the Prusa Mini's ejector.
